 * The <code>AnimatedSprite2D</code> class is responsible for providing multiple

 * <p>

 * <b>Example:</b>
 * Suppose you have the following textures (images):
 * <pre><code>
 * [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ]
 * </code></pre>
 * Each texture is a frame of an animation, with the <b>AnimatedSprite2D</b> control 
 * you can put them all together and generate an animation with it.
