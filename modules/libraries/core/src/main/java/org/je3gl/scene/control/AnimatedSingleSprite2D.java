/**
 * The <code>AnimatedSingleSprite2D</code> class is responsible for providing a
 * handling control to manipulate the mesh.
 * <p>
 * With this control we can create linear animations using a single texture that 
 * contains all the animations of the 2D mode.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b>
 * Suppose you have the following texture and inside are all the images of an animation:
 * <pre><code>
 * [ A, B, C, D, E ]
 * </code></pre>
 * Each image of the texture is a frame of an animation, with the <b>AnimatedSingleSprite2D</b>
 * control you can play them all and generate an animation indicating their position:
 *  <pre><code>
 * [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 * </code></pre>
