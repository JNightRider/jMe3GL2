 * An <code>AnimatedMaterialsHandlerFunction</code> interface is responsible for

 * This interface is useful because if you interact with the materials of the
 * objects (models), each of them has different properties that may or may not 
 * match. Therefore, it is important to maintain independence when applying 
 * animations to each model.
